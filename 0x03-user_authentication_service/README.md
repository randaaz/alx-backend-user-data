# User Authentication Service

## Project Overview

This project is about building a user authentication service using Flask and SQLAlchemy. The project is intended for educational purposes to understand the mechanisms of user authentication by implementing them from scratch.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Declare API routes in a Flask app
- Get and set cookies
- Retrieve request form data
- Return various HTTP status codes

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7
- Code should follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.5)
- Use SQLAlchemy 1.3.x
- All modules, classes, and functions must have documentation
- All functions should be type annotated
- Flask app should only interact with Auth and never with DB directly
- Only public methods of Auth and DB should be used outside these classes

## Setup

```bash
pip3 install bcrypt
